              Think about how much you need to borrow and select a payment
              amount that works for your budget. You choose how long you want to
              pay the loan back - take as long as 10 months to pay. Plus, you
              can pay your loan off early with no prepayment penalties.

            EmergencyRentalAssistance is a better way to borrow extra money when
            you need it. It’s not a payday loan. It’s an installment loan, which
            means you pay down the balance with each on-time payment. Borrow up
            to $1500 (up to $800 for new and repeat borrowers, up to $1500 for
            preferred customers with 10 or more loans). Then, pay us back a
            little at a time.
