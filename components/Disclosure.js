          Treasury’s Emergency Rental Assistance (ERA) program has provided
          communities over $46 billion to support housing stability throughout
          the COVID-19 pandemic. Participating governments have leveraged ERA
          funding to make over 10 million assistance payments to renters facing
          eviction, and research has shown that ERA assistance has supported
          low-income renters and renters of color. Combined with other
          Administration initiatives, Treasury’s ERA programs have helped to
          prevent millions of evictions since the onset of the pandemic. Two
          separate ERA programs have been established: the ERA1 program was
          authorized by the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2021 and provided
          $25 billion to assist eligible households with financial assistance
          and housing stability services. The ERA2 program was authorized by the
          American Rescue Plan Act of 2021 and provides $21.55 billion to assist
          eligible households with financial assistance, provide housing
          stability services, and as applicable, to cover the costs for other
          affordable rental housing and eviction prevention activities. ERA
          funds are provided directly to states, U.S. territories, local
          governments, and, in the case of ERA1, Indian Tribes or their Tribally
          Designated Housing Entities.
